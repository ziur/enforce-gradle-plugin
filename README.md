Quick start

## General description

This project is a Gradle plugin that provides useful tasks for implement a Continuous Integration process for SalesForce projects.

## How can you use this plugin?

Here you can find the enought required information to have running a Gradle project with Enforce.

1.Create build.gradle file on your source code project, below you have an example:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.fundacionjala.gradle.plugins.enforce:enforce-gradle-plugin:1.0.0'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'enforce'
enforce {
	srcPath = 'src'
}
```

2.Register a Salesforce credential to be used

```groovy
   $ gradle addCredential -Pid=default
			  	-Pusername=<USER NAME>
			  	-Ppassword=<PASSWORD>
			  	-Ptoken=<SECURITY TOKEN>
```

In this step is recomendable put credential id as ***default*** value, to run the EnForce tasks without using ***credentialId*** parameter.

Executing a task without ***credentialId*** parameter:

	$ gradle <TASK NAME>
	
It uses the default credential.
	
Executing a task with ***credentialId*** parameter:

	$ gradle <TASK NAME> -PcredentialId=<CREDENTIAL ID>
	
This credential will be saved in credentials.dat file located in user HOME directory.

3.Start executing available commands, for example, deploy all classes from your local repository to your organization.

```
   $ gradle deploy
```

Now you can start using all the Enforce features.

### Requirements
 * [Java JDK or JRE, version 7 or higher](http://java.com/en/).
 * [Gradle version 2.0 or higher](https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/installation.html).
 * Internet access ([configure Gradle if you are using a Proxy](https://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/build_environment.html)).

It is desired a basic knowledge about Gradle and its plugin mechanism, as starting point you can review:

 * [Writing custom plugins](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html)
 * [Gradle Custom Plugin](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/08/gradle-custom-plugin.html)

Once you have the source code, open the source code in a console and execute:

```
   $ gradle build
```

Please, make sure that your changes are not breaking any functionality running the unit test:
```
   $ gradle test
```
